Imagine is a *modeling* and *simulation* library based on computational graphs that provides many algorithms
with applications in physics, biology, chemistry, artificial intelligence and many more.

##### Research driven

Imagine's main objective is to help researchers from different areas to model and run numerical
simulations in a pleasant way, with performance and modularity.

## Getting started

To use imagine, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for cloning, [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the automation process, and a modern compiler (tested with [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)),
```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hrkz/imagine && cd imagine

# Start the compilation and download dependencies
$ python x.py
$ python t.py # Run tests (optional)
```
