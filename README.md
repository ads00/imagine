Imagine is a *modeling* and *simulation* library based on computational graphs that provides many algorithms
with applications in physics, biology, chemistry, artificial intelligence and many more.

##### Research driven

Imagine's main objective is to help researchers from different areas to model and run numerical
simulations in a pleasant way, with performance and modularity.

## Features

The key concept, based on data flow graphs, opens possibilities to design numerical simulations of
arbitrary structure and behavior;

* :globe_with_meridians: **Computational mathematics**

  Linear algebra  
  Ordinary and partial differential equations  
  Nonlinear optimization  
  Projective geometry, space partitioning and surface/volume representations  

* :computer: **High performance algorithms**
* :bar_chart: **Data analysis**
