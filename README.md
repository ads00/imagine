Imagine is a simulation library based on computational graphs that provides many algorithms
for light transport, continuum mechanics, artificial intelligence and many more.

##### Research driven

Imagine's main objective is to help researchers from different areas to model and run numerical
simulations in a pleasant way, with performance and modularity.

## Features

The key concept, based on data flow graphs, opens possibilities to design numerical simulations of
arbitrary structure and behavior;
