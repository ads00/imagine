Imagine is a modeling and simulation library based on computational graphs that provides many algorithms
with applications in physics, biology, chemistry, artificial intelligence and many more.

##### Research driven

Imagine's main objective is to help researchers from different areas to model and run numerical
simulations in a pleasant way, with performance and modularity.

## Features
