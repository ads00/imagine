Imagine is a graphics framework made with performances and modularity in mind.

Imagine was initially developed towards research & development and provides structures and algorithms to solve real world problems, render expressive and realistic images as well as interactive virtual worlds.

Technology    | for
--------------|---------
**C++14**     | Modern and effective C++ for the framework core
**Vulkan**    | Multithreaded rendering, shading 

## Features

* Computational mathematics
  * Expression template library for linear algebra (matrices / vectors and numerical solvers)
  * Geometric primitives, projective transformations and triangle meshes manipulation
  * Machine learning including neural nets, regression, classification, clustering and reinforcement
* Interactive environment
  * Cross-platform windowing and events handling
  * Vulkan renderer

At the moment, the development is focused on the renderer [Vulkan 1.0.x]. 
Next step will be to implement modern rendering techniques in order to produces interesting results/images.
