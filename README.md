Imagine is a research-oriented simulation library based on computational graphs that provides many algorithms for light transport, fluids and rigid body dynamics.

It's written in modern c++(17) with performance and modularity in mind.

## Features

The key concept, based on data flow graphs, opens possibilities to design numerical simulations of arbitrary structure and behavior;

* :globe_with_meridians: **Computational mathematics**

	Linear algebra  
	Projective geometry, space partitioning and surface representations  
	Nonlinear optimization  
	Ordinary and partial differential equations

* :video_game: **Interactive cross-platform environment**
* :high_brightness: **Rendering**
* :running: **Animation**
* :wavy_dash: **Fluids and rigid body dynamics**
